<div class="dropcap">C</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">C</span>rimson clover (<i>Trifolium incarnatum</i>) is the most important
winter annual legume of the central section of the Eastern States.
This crop can be grown over a much larger area by using seed of
adapted varieties for each section, by using better cultural methods,
and by fertilizing the soil (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). Besides being an excellent pasture
plant and furnishing plenty of
hay, it protects the soil during
fall, winter, and spring, prevents
soil washing, and provides green
manure for soil improvement.
This legume has the distinct
advantage of producing large
quantities of seed that can be
easily harvested and sown without
the use of expensive machinery.
Crimson clover is a native of
Europe and is widely grown in
France, Hungary, and other central
and southern European
countries. Seed was introduced
into this country as early as 1819,
but it was not until 1880 that the
plant became important. The
acreage has been steadily increasing.
During the 5-year period 1940-45 the annual purchase of
seed through markets in the United States has ranged from 6 to 18
million pounds. In 1935 about 2 million pounds were used. In addition,
large quantities of home-grown seed are handled from farm to
farm.</p>

<p>The common name of this clover is derived from the bright crimson
color of the blossoms. Other such common names as German clover
and scarlet clover are frequently used. In general the leaves and stems
resemble those of red clover, but are distinguished by the rounded tips
of the leaves and more hair on both leaves and stems. When crimson
clover is planted in fall the leaves develop from the crown and form
a rosette, which enlarges whenever weather conditions are favorable.
In spring, flower stems develop rapidly and end their growth with
long pointed flower heads. Seed forms and the plant dies with the
coming of hot summer weather. The seed is yellow and is about
twice as large as red clover seed and more rounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[ 3 ]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Adaptation" id="Adaptation"><b>Adaptation</b></a></h2>


<p>Crimson clover does well in cool, humid weather and is tolerant of
winter conditions where the temperature does not become severe or too
changeable. It may be planted from midsummer to late fall. In the
northern part of the region early seeding and growth are necessary for
the seedlings to survive the winter. It will thrive both on sandy and
clay soils and is tolerant of ordinary soil acidity. On very poor soils,
stands are difficult to obtain and the growth is stunted. The use of
phosphate and potash fertilizers and manure on such soils will help to
obtain good stands.</p>

<p>Crimson clover may also be grown successfully as a summer annual
in northern Maine, Michigan, and Minnesota. Winter culture can
be extended into Kentucky, southern Missouri, southern Indiana, and
Ohio, provided varieties are grown that are adapted to these sections
and the seed is sown in fertile soils early in August.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Seedbed_Preparation" id="Seedbed_Preparation"><b>Seedbed Preparation</b></a></h2>


<p>The most important and difficult part of producing a large crop is
getting a stand. Enough soil moisture to sprout the seed and establish
the seedlings is the greatest factor in obtaining a stand. When
established, common crimson clover usually produces a good crop.</p>

<p>Seedings may be made alone or combined with winter grains, ryegrass,
or grass sod. It is possible also to seed between the rows of
cultivated crops, but it is difficult to make an ideal seedbed. Furthermore,
the crop plants in the row shade the clover seedlings and use
some of the available moisture. If the row crop is planted in wider
rows and seeded more thinly, the clover will become better established.
When planted between the rows of other crops, the seed is usually
broadcast on the surface and covered by cultivating or harrowing.
Drilling the seed after the soil surface has been stirred usually gives
more complete stands than broadcasting, and it may be done with a
small one-horse drill. The seed should not be planted more than one-half
to three-fourths of an inch deep, respectively, in clay and sandy
soils.</p>

<p>Crimson clover is often seeded following a grain crop. This is a
surer method of establishing a stand than planting between the rows
of cultivated crops, provided the seedbed is well prepared. After the
grain crop is harvested the soil is plowed or disked and allowed to
settle. This is followed by light harrowing or disking to kill weed
seedlings. Before the clover is seeded the sod should be firmly packed,
because a loose cloddy seedbed will not produce good stands. The
seed may be either drilled or broadcast, but drilling will give more
uniform stands.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Fertilizers" id="Fertilizers"><b>Fertilizers</b></a></h2>


<p>Good stands and growth cannot be expected on very poor soils.
Soil conditions can be improved by adding phosphate and potash
fertilizers and manure or by turning under such crops as cowpeas,
soybeans, or lespedeza. In many soils of low fertility the use of a
complete fertilizer will encourage early seedling growth and establishment.
On fertile sods crimson clover may be successfully grown without
fertilizer, but on most sods applications of 200 to 400 pounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[ 4 ]</a></span>
per acre of phosphate and 50 to 100 pounds of potash pay in obtaining
good stands and vigorous growth (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>).</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 495px;"><a id="fig2"></a>
<img src="images/fig2.png" width="495" height="293" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Effect of phosphate application on good soil: Treated (left);
untreated (right).</div>
</div>

<p>Frequently a single large application of phosphate and potash fertilizer
is sufficient to produce two crops of crimson clover before it
becomes necessary to make another application. In some soils the
addition of such minor elements as boron may improve growth and
increase seed yields. Since the need for minor elements varies from
place to place, their use should be based on the recommendations of
the agricultural experiment station of the State in which the clover is
planted.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Seed_Sources_and_Varieties" id="Seed_Sources_and_Varieties"><b>Seed Sources and Varieties</b></a></h2>


<p>Before World War II more than half the crimson clover seed used
in the United States was imported, principally from Hungary and
France. Since 1938 domestic production has rapidly increased, reaching
more than 18 million pounds in 1942. Tennessee produced more
than half the home supply. Nearly all the crimson clover may be
called common crimson clover, since it does not represent strains or
varieties having special characteristics. White-flower strains and several
others that differ slightly in maturity have been selected but have
not been used.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Dixie_Crimson_Clover" id="Dixie_Crimson_Clover"><b>Dixie Crimson Clover</b></a></h2>


<p>Dixie crimson clover is a new hard-seeded variety that has given
promising results in extensive trials. It is more widely adapted than
common crimson clover, as it grows well in the Gulf coast section and
appears to be slightly more winter-hardy than common crimson.
Dixie has successfully volunteered to good stands when grown in pastures
with Bermuda grass, with small grains for grazing, and in rotation
with such cultivated crops as sorghum or late-planted corn.</p>

<p>Seed of Dixie shattered in harvesting operations has successfully
produced good volunteer stands in fall. When used in rotations with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[ 5 ]</a></span>
cultivated crops, the seed must be matured before the seedbed is prepared
for the following crop. When Dixie is used in pasture, care
should be taken to prevent close grazing at the time of blooming, since
it may limit the quantity of seed produced and cause thin fall stands.
Summer-growing grasses must be either closely grazed or clipped in
fall to give the clover seedlings a chance to become established.</p>

<p>The seed and plants of Dixie cannot be distinguished from common
crimson clover, and the variety may be readily contaminated by
either cross-pollination or mechanical mixtures. For these reasons
the farmer buying Dixie should buy only certified seed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Rate_and_Time_of_Seeding" id="Rate_and_Time_of_Seeding"><b>Rate and Time of Seeding</b></a></h2>


<p>Under ordinary conditions 12 to 15 pounds of hulled seed to the
acre will give good stands unless there is lack of soil moisture.
Depending upon the quantity of chaff and pieces of stems, 45 to 60
pounds of unhulled seed is comparable with 15 pounds of hulled seed.
Crimson clover may be sown from the middle of July until November,
depending upon the location, with the expectation of obtaining a good
stand. The later it is seeded the less growth can be expected and the
more readily winterkilling occurs. Early establishment becomes more
important as plantings are extended northward. Seeding crimson
clover either immediately before or following heavy rains, if possible,
increases its chances of making a stand. Spring planting in or south
of the Corn Belt usually results in a short, stunted growth followed by
little blossoming and low yield.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Inoculation" id="Inoculation"><b>Inoculation</b></a></h2>


<p>In many areas where crimson clover has been grown successfully for
several years it is not necessary to inoculate the seed with bacterial
cultures for the production of nodules. But either the seed or the
soil must be inoculated if crimson clover has not been grown. If the
plants are not inoculated they will develop slowly, become yellow,
and die. Inoculated plants are able to obtain about two-thirds of
then nitrogen from the air through then root nodules. The plants
may be artificially inoculated by applying cultures of the bacteria to
the seed or by scattering soil from a field where inoculated crimson
clover has been grown. Two hundred to three hundred pounds per
acre of such soil evenly distributed at seeding time is usually sufficient.</p>

<p>When crimson clover is grown for the first time an additional
inoculation treatment is recommended if weather conditions are dry
and hot after seeding. This supplemental inoculation consists in
mixing commercial cultures with sand, soil, or cottonseed meal and
broadcasting the mixture over the soil surface during cloudy, rainy
weather as the young seedlings are emerging. A bushel-size culture
mixed with 60 pounds of the above-mentioned material is sufficient
for an acre if distributed evenly. Soil from a field where inoculated
crimson clover has been grown may also be used for the supplemental
treatment.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Unhulled_Seed" id="Unhulled_Seed"><b>Unhulled Seed</b></a></h2>


<p>Using unhulled common seed increases the chance of obtaining
thick stands. When the soil is dry, light rainfall does not cause the
unhulled seed to sprout, but hulled seed germinates readily and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[ 6 ]</a></span>
seedlings may die from lack of moisture before they can become
established.</p>

<p>Its bulky nature makes unhulled seed more difficult to distribute
uniformly than hulled seed. It must be broadcast and may be
harrowed in. It is also difficult to market and is not generally
handled by the seed trade. But farmers can harvest seed for their
own use and save the expense of having it hulled.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Companion_Crops" id="Companion_Crops"><b>Companion Crops</b></a></h2>


<p>Rye, vetch, ryegrass, and fall-sown grain crops are often seeded
with crimson clover. Such crops are seeded at half to a third the
normal rate, and the crimson clover is seeded at half to two-thirds
the normal rate. Seeding is done at the same time, but, as a greater
depth is required for most of the seed of the companion crops, two
seeding operations are necessary.</p>

<p>Farmers often use a mixture of 5 pounds of red clover and 10 pounds
of crimson clover per acre with excellent results. The first growth
of the mixture may be grazed or harvested for hay or for crimson
clover seed, while the second crop is wholly red clover. Dixie crimson
clover has given good results when planted with Johnson and
Bermuda grasses.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Diseases_and_Insects" id="Diseases_and_Insects"><b>Diseases and Insects</b></a></h2>


<p>The most serious disease that affects crimson clover is crown rot.
The effect of this disease is seen early in spring and is characterized
by the plants dying in patches. The stems rot at the surface of the
soil or where they join the crown. Continued damp, cool weather
during winter and early spring favors the development of the disease.
This disease can be controlled by not growing clover or other legumes
in rotation for 2 to 5 years.</p>

<p>Sandy soils in the southern part of the crimson clover belt are often
infested with nematodes. Nematode injury stunts and yellows the
plants. While the clover-seed chalcid, the pea aphid, and other insects
sometimes become numerous in crimson clover, insects do not
ordinarily cause appreciable damage.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Utilization" id="Utilization"><b>Utilization</b></a></h2>


<p>Crimson clover grows rapidly in fall and spring and furnishes an
abundance of grazing (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). If planted early and good fall growth
is made, the clover may also be grazed during the fall and winter
months. Such a practice has been successfully followed in many
States where crimson clover is providing winter pasture. Crimson
clover combined with small grains or ryegrass has been most widely
used for winter grazing. Crimson clover makes little growth during
cold periods in winter. Under such conditions, to prevent close
grazing, it is necessary to remove the animals or shift them to other
fields that have not been grazed.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 494px;"><a id="fig3"></a>
<img src="images/fig3.png" width="494" height="266" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 3.</span>&mdash;Crimson clover provides an abundance of early spring grazing.</div>
</div>

<p>Animals grazing on crimson clover seldom bloat; however, it is
advisable not to turn them into clover fields for the first time when
they are hungry. Bloat is less likely to occur on a mixture of clover
and grass or grain then when the clover alone is grazed. As crimson
clover reaches maturity the hairs of the heads and stems become hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[ 7 ]</a></span>
and tough. When it is grazed continuously or when it is fed as hay
at this stage large masses of the hairs are liable to form into hair balls
in stomachs of horses and mules, occasionally with fatal results. If
small quantities of other feeds, particularly roughages, are fed along
with the clover, the formation of these balls will be reduced. Cattle,
sheep, and swine do not seem to be affected.</p>

<p>Crimson clover makes excellent hay when cut at the early-bloom
stage, although the yield may be slightly reduced. For best yields it
should be harvested in full bloom. The hay is easily cured either in
the swath or in the windrow. Fewer leaves are lost and less bleaching
occurs in windrowed hay. Although yields as high as 2&frac12; tons
per acre are not uncommon on fertile soil, 1&frac12; to 2 tons is the usual
harvest.</p>

<p>Crimson clover is an ideal green-manure crop. For best results it
should be plowed under 2 to 3 weeks before the succeeding crop is
planted. This gives enough time for decomposition, which is rapid
unless the crop is ripe when turned under. Occasionally strips are
plowed in which row crops are to be planted, allowing the clover
between the plowed strips to mature. Seed may be harvested by
hand from the clover between the row crops, and the remaining
clover straw allowed to mat and serve as a mulch, or the entire plant
may be permitted to form a mulch.</p>

<p>Crimson clover may be made into silage by the same methods as
are used for other legumes and grasses. In orchards it is often allowed
to mature, after which it is disked into the soil. A volunteer
stand from shattered seed may be obtained in fall by using the Dixie
variety.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Seed_Production" id="Seed_Production"><b>Seed Production</b></a></h2>


<p>Crimson clover is a heavy seed-producing plant, and yields of 5
to 10 bushels per acre are common, depending upon the thickness of
the stand, the extent of growth produced, and the care used in harvesting
the seed. The florets are self-fertile, but bees increase the number
of seed per head by tripping and transferring the pollen. Placing
colonies of honeybees next to blooming fields will increase pollination.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[ 8 ]</a></span>
More seed is usually produced on soils of medium fertility than on
rich soils, since fertile soils seem to stimulate the growth of stems and
leaves rather than develop flower heads.</p>

<p>Large yields and ease of harvesting seed are two important reasons
why crimson clover is such an ideal legume crop. Farmers can save
seed with very little expense other than their own labor. When the
seed heads are mature they readily shatter and are easily harvested
either by hand stripping or by using horse-drawn home-made strippers.
One bushel of unhulled seed contains about 2 pounds of hulled
seed, and although bulky, it can be easily stored on the farm until fall.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 496px;"><a id="fig4"></a>
<img src="images/fig4.png" width="496" height="224" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 4.</span>&mdash;Crimson clover seed crop cut with a mower equipped with a
bunching attachment.</div>
</div>

<p>When the seed is mature the crop is cut with a mower (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>), which
may be equipped with a bunching or windrowing attachment, or it
can be harvested with a combine. During wet seasons it is sometimes
difficult to combine the seed from standing plants. Under such conditions
the plants can be cut and windrowed and than threshed by
the combine from the windrow. As crimson clover shatters easily
when ripe, cutting with the mower when the heads are damp with dew
or rain is recommended. If it is allowed to stand too long after
ripening a beating rain will shatter much of the seed. After a few
days of curing, the seed is hulled with an ordinary clover huller, with a
grain separator equipped with hulling attachments, or by a combine
equipped with pick-up attachments or used as a stationary machine.
The less the clover is handled the less seed will be lost by shattering.
Many troublesome weeds are difficult to separate from crimson
clover seed, including field peppergrass (<i>Lepidium campestre</i>),
wintercress (<i>Barbarea praecox</i>), and the bulblets of wild onion (<i>Allium</i> spp.),
which are probably the worst. Seed of the mustards, rapes, and
turnips (<i>Brassica</i> spp.), dock (<i>Rumex crispus</i>), wild geranium
(<i>Geranium dissectum</i>), sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosella</i>), and catchweed (<i>Galium
aparine</i>) are also found in the seed. Little barley (<i>Hordeum pusillum</i>)
is a pest in unhulled seed, and the use of such seed will naturally
increase the prevalence of this weed.</p>
